      question: "How much does a translation cost?",
      answer:
        "Translation prices are based on source word count, although other factors like the complexity of the subject matter (a technical manual, for instance) may lead to a variation in the rates. I do, however, offer first-time clients discounts and special prizes. Contact me & get a free quote!",
    },
    {
      question: "How long will it take for my book to be ready?",
      answer:
        "The time it takes me to translate a book will also be connected to the type of book. But to give you a general idea, a novel 70,000 words long and moderate difficulty would take me 3 months to complete and the final product will always be a “ready-to-publish” translation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get a quote?",
      answer:
        "It’s not necessary for you to send me your entire book in order to get a quote. All I need are the first three chapters and the total amount of words. Contact me and I will get back to you within 48 hours!",
    },
    {
      question: "What else can a translator do?",
      answer:
        "Apart from translating your book, I will edit & proof-read it so that you will have a ready-to-publish version of your book in Spanish. Also, I can translate any marketing material connected to the promotion of your translation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the translation process like?",
      answer:
        "In the first stage of the translation process, I will carefully read your text. I will write down all potential translation challenges while also becoming acquainted with the tone & voice of your novel. Later, comes the translation itself. In this stage, I might contact you to clarify any ambiguities and to give you follow-ups on the translation. Once the translation is over, I will focus on the proof-reading, during which I will check the translation against the original making sure both texts align and that the translation is accurate and faithful. Finally, I will edit the translation as a new text on its own: here is when I will be checking for spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc. The deadline set by both translator and author, covers this entire process, so your translation will be delivered as scheduled!",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I pay for your translation services?",
      answer:
        "I accept payments through various methods such as bank transfer or PayPal. Payment details are discussed during the quoting process.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I be sure of the quality of your translation?",
      answer:
        "I have experience and training in translation, and I strive to provide accurate and high-quality translations. You can go to the translation samples section and view examples of my previous work.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is your revision and correction policy?",
      answer:
        "The translation process includes the revision and correction stage. Once the translation of the text is completed, I turn to the phase of proofreading and editing, during which I review it thoroughly, first against the original text and then as a Spanish version, ensuring there are no grammar or spelling errors in the target text.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I am not satisfied with the final translation?",
      answer:
        "If you are not satisfied with the final translation, we will work together to resolve any issues and make the necessary revisions until you are content with the result.",
